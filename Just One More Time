Just one more time
Just one more time I'll find my purpose in absurdidty

---
--
I'm certain this time it wont end in calamity
---
--
I'm trapped in these traipseeistic catastrophes
At last it seems I've got the master Scheme
Automatically my roots are in what's best for me
Now I'm stress free
---
Perfectly divided my attention on my destiny
My first decree lets break the e's

---
Second is my tendanc...y to slip back into habit
