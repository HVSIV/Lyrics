I'm not exactly great at first impressions
Your recollections affecting the mechanisms
That's testing my mind and its proclivity
To master cognativity 
The dissonance that's distinsin my mind
From proper influance

Trauma sets up shop between anxiety and confidance
Become the personification of a homonymn
It's marketing

The market sees what it's supposed to see
And then the most of me
Is tryna figure out what parts are superfluicity
